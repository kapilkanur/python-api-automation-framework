# Python based REST API automation framework

## Setting up the application under test

The AUT is [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore3.swagger.io). The test suite in the framework would cover user, store, and pet endpoint functionalities. 
To avoid output that is unreliable, host the website locally, you can do so by following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/README.md).
